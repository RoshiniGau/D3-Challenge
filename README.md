# D3-Challenge

In this project using the D3 techniques taught in class, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements and created and situated axes , labels to the left and bottom of the chart .
Using more demographics and more risk factors placed additional labels in scatter plot and gave them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for  circles' locations as well as the range of axes and implemented D3-tip. The link to this is found below .
